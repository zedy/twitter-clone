# Twitter Clone

This app is intended to be used as a coding challenge and knowledge sharing (within my company). 
The goal is to create a working replica of twitter (the posting part, we don't care about the rest)
and then use the codebase as a jumping off point for less experiences devs to aclimate to using different
types of services and to learn how to build real world prod ready applications.
